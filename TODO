-- Database.LMDB
1. create newkey command analogous to newtbl
2. perhaps newtbl should accept an initializer
	- pros: gaurantee a key or two is there whenever a table is, and
		that they are the first keys added. useful?
	- cons: longer blocking write transaction, but could warn user in the haddock
3. link with cpu package? and have endianness flag appended to numbers?
--- lmdbtool
1. work newtbl into lmdbtool
